## Installation

To run the Sorting and Searching Visualizer locally, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory: <br />
   `cd Sorting-and-Searching-Visualizer`
2. Install the required dependencies: <br />
   `npm install`
3. Start the development server:<br />
   `npm run dev`
4. Open your web browser and visit `local host` to see the application running.

## Usage

The Sorting and Searching Visualizer provides a user-friendly interface to explore various sorting and searching algorithms. Upon opening the application, you will be presented with a randomly generated array of elements.

To visualize a sorting algorithm, select the desired algorithm from the dropdown menu and click the "Sort" button. The visualizer will then demonstrate the step-by-step execution of the chosen algorithm, rearranging the elements in real-time.

Similarly, to visualize a searching algorithm, select the desired algorithm and enter the value you wish to search for. The visualizer will highlight the process of traversing the dataset and locating the specified value.

You can adjust the speed of the visualization using the provided slider or pause/resume the animation at any point for a closer examination.
